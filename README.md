## Getting Started

Let me break down the project and guide you to the different screens.

Under the Lib folder, you can find the main.dart which represents the initial code.

Under lib, you will find 4 directories, namely

Firebase Services - which will contain code for firebase services as well as splash screen services.

UI - contains splash screen code as well authentication pages, like login screen and sign up screen

Widget -  contains code for the RoundButton widget, which can come in handy multiple times in project

Utils -  contains utlities for the main screen codes, like flutterToaster which helps in delivering the error message to the screen while signing up. 


This App is still under development, and is intended to potray the skills of all of the operations on firebase.
